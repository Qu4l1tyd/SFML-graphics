# SFML graphics

This is a really simple pong demo using SFML library
to draw graphics with C++.

1. Open terminal in the directory that you have downloaded this

2. Install SFML
```bash
sudo apt install libsfml-dev
```

3. Compile the code using this command (g++ is required):
```bash
./compile.sh
```

4. If you don't have permission to compile, allow the execution for the
    compile script:
```bash
chmod -x compile.sh
```
